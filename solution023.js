/*Coding in function pickIt, function accept 1 parameter:arr, it's a number array, we need traverse arr by using for loop, if element is odd number, push it to array odd, if it's a even number, push it to array even.

I've defined two array odd and even in the function, and also wrote the return statement. your work is write a for loop.*/


//producing even for loop
let i = 2;
for (; i <= 10; i++){
    if (i % 2 == 0)continue;{


//producing odd 

for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++){
    if(i % 2 == 0)continue;
}

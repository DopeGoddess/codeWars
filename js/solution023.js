/*Coding in function pickIt, function accept 1 parameter:arr, it's a number array, we need traverse arr by using for loop, if element is odd number, push it to array odd, if it's a even number, push it to array even.

I've defined two array odd and even in the function, and also wrote the return statement. your work is write a for loop.*/



//producing even for loop
const ourArray = [];
for (let i = 0; i < 10;  i +=2) {

}

//producing odd 
const myArray= [];

for(let i = 1; i < 10; i +=2) {
 
}

//so i know how to put it seperate
